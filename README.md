# landingpage
This is a simple project in order for me to understand HTML/CSS as well as mastering flexbox

I will be cloning a landing page website that was given at this link

This is to better understand more of the frontend part of the project and incorporate what I learned throughout the lessons

These include but not limited to

HTML
CSS
FlexBox
margin/padding/border
